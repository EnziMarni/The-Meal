      'ostada quite literally means "toasted" and typically refers to dishes made over crispy flat tortillas that are either oven toasted or fried. "They can be compared to an open faced sandwich in how the toppings usually lay over one crispy tortilla, though sometimes youll find layered varieties too, says Kelly Jones MS, RD, CSSD, LDN.Tacos and tostadas are very similar.The main difference is that a tostada is flat and made on a crispy tortilla shell, usually corn. Tacos, while they can be made in crispy corn shells, are most commonly seen soft, folded, with either corn or flour tortillas,says Jessica Formicola, chef and blogger at Savory Experiments. Since the word tostada means toasted, a toasted, crunchy base is a necessity for tostadas. The other difference Because they are folded, tacos are typically less messy and easier to eat with your hands, Jones adds.',

      "A hamburger, or simply burger, is a food consisting of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chilis; condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a special sauce, often a variation of Thousand Island dressing; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger patty topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger.The term burger can also be applied to the meat patty on its own, especially in the United Kingdom, where the term patty is rarely used, or the term can even refer simply to ground beef. Since the term hamburger usually implies beef, for clarity burger may be prefixed with the type of meat or meat substitute used, as in beef burger, turkey burger, bison burger, portobello burger, or veggie burger. In Australia and New Zealand, a piece of chicken breast on a bun is known as a chicken burger, which would generally not be considered to be a burger in the United States; where it would generally be called a chicken sandwich, but in Australian English and New Zealand English a sandwich requires sliced bread (not a bun), so it would not be considered a sandwich",
